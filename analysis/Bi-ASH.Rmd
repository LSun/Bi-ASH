#Setting#

We have observations $\hat\beta_j$ of true effect $\beta_j$ with estimated measurement error $\hat s_j$, as well as covariate $X_j$.  The true effects presumably have stochastic orders according to their covariates.  We hope to make covariate-modulated inference of the true effects by sharing information among all the data using empirical Bayes methods.


#Model#

As suggest by Matthew, the general model is

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\beta_j = \alpha_j + X_j\gamma_j\\
\hat\beta_j|\hat s_j \sim N(\beta_j,\hat s_j^2) \text{ independently}\\
j=1,\ldots,J
\end{array}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\alpha_j \sim f^{\alpha}(\cdot) \text{ exchangeably, }f^\alpha \text{ uniform, maybe symmetric}\\
\gamma_j \sim f^{\gamma}(\cdot) \text{ exchangeably, }f^\gamma \text{ uniform, maybe symmetric}\\
X_j \text{ binary or continuous}
\end{array}
$$

In this setting, if $X_j$ is continuous, larger $|X_j|$ leads to stochastically larger $\beta_j$; if $X_j$ is binary (0 or 1), true effects in Group1 is stochastically larger than those in Group0.

Now we make further assumptions that both $f^\alpha$ and $f^\gamma$ are mixture of zero-mean normals. That is,

$$
\begin{array}{c}
f^\alpha=\sum\limits_{k=1}^K\pi_k^{\alpha}N(0,{\sigma_k^\alpha}^2)\\
f^\gamma=\sum\limits_{l=1}^L\pi_l^{\gamma}N(0,{\sigma_l^\gamma}^2)
\end{array}
$$

Then the likelihood of $\hat\beta_j$'s given $\hat s_j$'s is

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
p(\hat\beta|\hat s)&=&\prod\limits_{j=1}^{J}(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}\sum\limits_{l=1}^{L}\pi_k^\alpha\pi_l^\gamma N(\hat\beta_j;0,{\sigma_k^\alpha}^2+X_j^2{\sigma_l^\gamma}^2+\hat s_j^2))\\
&=&\prod\limits_{j=1}^{J}(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}\sum\limits_{l=1}^{L}\pi_k^\alpha\pi_l^\gamma f_{jkl})
\end{array}
$$

If we can pre-select grids of $\sigma_k^\alpha$ and $\sigma_l^\gamma$, the problem becomes a bi-convex optimization,

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\max\limits_{\pi_{1:K}^\alpha,\pi_{1:L}^\gamma}& \sum\limits_{j=1}^J\log(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}\sum\limits_{l=1}^{L}\pi_k^\alpha\pi_l^\gamma f_{jkl})+\sum\limits_{k=1}^K(\lambda_k^\alpha-1)\log\pi_k^\alpha+\sum\limits_{l=1}^L(\lambda_l^\gamma-1)\log\pi_l^\gamma\\
\text{s.t.}& \sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}\pi_k^\alpha=\sum\limits_{l=1}^{L}\pi_l^\gamma=1\\
& \pi_{1:K}^\alpha\geq0,\ \pi_{1:L}^\gamma\geq0
\end{array}
$$

$\lambda_{1:K}^\alpha$, $\lambda_{1:L}^\gamma$ being penalty terms, which can be solved by bi-EM algorithm using modified ASH functions in [*bi-ash.R*](../code/R/bi-ash.R).

#Model, Simplified#

Now we need to fill the 3-way array $F_{JKL}=\{f_{jkl}\}$, and the key is to determine the two grids of $\sigma$: $\sigma_{1:K}^\alpha$, $\sigma_{1:L}^\gamma$.  It turns out the problem is trickier when $X$ is continous, so we only consider the case when $X$ is binary.  Then the problem can be re-written as a two-group model.

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\text{Group0: }& \beta_{0j}=\alpha_{0j}\\
&\hat\beta_{0j}|\hat s_{0j}\sim N(\beta_{0j},\hat s_{0j}^2) \text{ independently}\\
\text{Group1: }& \beta_{1j}=\alpha_{1j}+\gamma_{1j}\\
&\hat\beta_{1j}|\hat s_{1j}\sim N(\beta_{1j},\hat s_{1j}^2) \text{ independently}\\
\alpha_{ij}&\sim\sum\limits_{k=1}^K\pi_k^\alpha N(0,{\sigma_k^\alpha}^2) \text{ exchangeably, } i=0,1\\
\gamma_{1j}&\sim\sum\limits_{l=1}^L\pi_l^\gamma N(0,{\sigma_l^\gamma}^2) \text{ exchangeably}
\end{array}
$$

Under the setting, true effects in Group1 would be stochastically larger than true effects in Group0. (*\textcolor{blue}{May need theoretical justification.}*)

Then the likelihood of $\hat\beta_j$'s given $\hat s_j$'s is

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\text{Group0:} & p(\hat\beta_0|\hat s_0)=\prod\limits_{j=1}^{J_0}(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}\pi_k^\alpha N(\hat\beta_{0j};0,{\sigma_k^\alpha}^2+\hat s_{0j}^2))\\
\text{Group1:} & p(\hat\beta_1|\hat s_1)=\prod\limits_{j=1}^{J_1}(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}\pi_k^\alpha\pi_l^\gamma N(\hat\beta_{1j};0,{\sigma_k^\alpha}^2+{\sigma_l^\gamma}^2+\hat s_{1j}^2))\\
\end{array}
$$

The choice of grids of $\sigma$ is not perfectly straightforward since $\sigma_{1:K}^\alpha$ affects both groups, Group0 and Group1; moreover, Group1 is affected by both grids, $\sigma_{1:K}^\alpha$ and $\sigma_{1:L}^\gamma$.  *\textcolor{blue}{We have yet to find a good way to generate the two grids appropriately.}*

Here we use \texttt{ashr:::autoselect.mixsd} to determine the two grids as follows.

```{r eval=FALSE}
sigmaalpha = ashr:::autoselect.mixsd(betahat0,sebetahat0,sqrt(2))
sigmagamma = ashr:::autoselect.mixsd(betahat1,sebetahat1,sqrt(2))
```

Note that here we choose $\sigma_{1:K}^\alpha$ only using the data in Group0, even though they also affect the data in Group1; likewise, we choose $\sigma_{1:L}^\gamma$ as if the influence of $\alpha_{1j}$ doesn't exit.  And we exclude 0 in both grids.  The simplificatio is to make the process easier, and as in ASH, if the grids are dense enough, the result should be accurate enough.

With the fixed grids of $\sigma$, the 3-way array of likelihood can be filled by the *R* function [*bilik*](../code/R/bilik.R).

#Simulation#

We simulate two groups of data as follows.

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\text{Group0: }& \beta_{0j}=\alpha_{0j}, j=1,\ldots,100\\
&\hat\beta_{0j}|\hat s_{0j}=1\sim N(\beta_{0j},1) \text{ independently}\\
\text{Group1: }& \beta_{1j}=\alpha_{1j}+\gamma_{1j}, j=1,\ldots,100\\
&\hat\beta_{1j}|\hat s_{1j}=1\sim N(\beta_{1j},1) \text{ independently}\\
\alpha_{ij}&\sim 0.5\delta_0 + 0.5N(0,2^2) \text{ exchangeably, } i=0,1\\
\gamma_{1j}&\sim 0.9\delta_0 + 0.1N(0,5^2) \text{ exchangeably}
\end{array}
$$

The idea is, each group has 100 observations.  The "additional effects" in Group1, compared with Group0, are mostly 0, but occasionally very large.

Then we feed the simulated data into our bi-ASH machine, get the log-likelihood $l_{\text{MLE}}$ of the MLE, as well as the log-likelihood $l_{\text{True}}$ of the true distribution, and obtain log-likelihood ratio the test statistic $\Delta=2(l_{\text{MLE}}-l_{\text{True}})$, which presumably follows a $\chi^2$ distribution.  Note that we don't use penalty right now.

The simulation is run by an *R* script [*biASHSim*](../code/biASHSim.R).

```{r}
Delta=scan("../output/LLRT.txt")
conv=scan("../output/conv.txt")
mean(conv)
Delta=Delta[conv==1]
d=mean(Delta)
hist(Delta,prob=T,xlab=expression(Delta),main="")
x=seq(0,max(Delta)+1,length=100)
lines(x,dchisq(x,d),col="blue",lty=3)
```

Only `r mean(conv)*100`\% of the time, bi-EM converges, and all converged log-likelihood ratio test statistics $\Delta$ are approximately $\chi^2$, indicating that we've obtain some sort of MLE.

#Goal#

We hope to statistically analyze the difference of of true effects distributions in two groups, assuming we know a priori that one group's true effects should be stochastically larger than the other's.
